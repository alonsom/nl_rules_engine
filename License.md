1. Grant of License
1.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including receipt and acceptance by Ideasol Australia of an
order submitted on-line by Company (“Order”), Ideasol Australia grants to Company a no-charge, nonexclusive and
nontransferable limited license to use the Ideasol Australia software covered by the Order and its accompanying
documentation (together, referred to herein as “Software”) for Company’s internal business requirements.
The Software is licensed on a limited number of users and/or
other use bases, as set forth in Order. “Users,” as used here, means an individual Company employee
installing or using the Software. When an individual installs or uses the Software on multiple devices, each
such installation or use shall be associated with that one User; and when multiple individuals use the Software
on the same device, then each individual shall be considered a User. The license granted to Company
includes, to the extent covered by a Order, the right to (i) use Server components of the Software to provide
Users with access to the functionalities and content available through the Software; and (ii) distribute or enable
Users to download Applications for use with the Server components, to access the functionalities and content
available through the Applications, in each case, during the license term and not exceeding the authorized
number of Users. UNDER THIS NO CHARGE LICENSE, THE AUTHORIZED NUMBER OF USERS IS
LIMITED TO TEN (10) USERS AND IN NO EVENT MAY THE NUMBER OF USERS EXCEED THE
AUTHORIZED NUMBER.
1.2. The Software is licensed, not sold, and this Agreement grants only certain rights to use the Software. This
license transfers to Company neither title nor any proprietary or intellectual property rights to the Software,
enhancements to the Software and documentation, or any copyrights, patents, or trademarks, embodied or
used in connection therewith, except for the limited right to use expressly granted herein. All intellectual
property rights, whether registered or unregistered, evidenced by or embodied in and/or attached/connected/
related to the Software or documentation, or part thereof, and any improvements thereof, are and shall be
owned exclusively by Ideasol Australia. The license granted to Company hereunder is for object code versions only
and does not include the Software source code.
1.3. Ideasol Australia will provide Company with the Software electronically, except as otherwise agreed. Company may
make a reasonable number of machine-readable copies of the Software for disaster recovery and testing
purposes. Company will maintain up-to-date records about the number, location, and use of all copies of the
Software and number of Users and upon Ideasol Australia’s written request, will provide this information to Ideasol Australia
and confirm compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Ideasol Australia may, with reasonable advance notice,
audit applicable Company records to verify Company’s compliance with this Agreement. Copies of the
documentation may be made by Company for its own internal needs. All copies of the Software and
documentation will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Whenever Company is permitted
to copy or reproduce all or any part of the Software or documentation, all titles, trademark symbols, copyright
symbols and legends, and other proprietary markings must also be reproduced.
3. License Restrictions
Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, Company may not itself or through any party: (i) sell,
sublicense, transfer, disclose, make available to, or permit use of the Software by any third party; (ii) translate,
adapt, circumvent any technical protection or enable any limited or disabled functionality; (iii) decompile,
disassemble, or reverse engineer, or make any additions or modifications to the Software, except (a) to the
extent expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; and (b) to debug changes made
by Company to a third party library to the extent this right is required by the license associated with the library;
(iv) write or develop any derivative or other software program or product based upon the Software or
Confidential Information; (v) use the Software other than in accordance with the authorization contained
herein; or (vi) use the Software or part thereof to provide application hosting, outsourcing, testing, or similar

4. No-Charge License
The license granted to Company hereunder is a no-charge license. However, if the Company exceeds the license granted
in this Agreement, including by exceeding the permitted number of Users, Ideasol Australia may suspend the Company’s
access to and use of the Software. These remedies are without prejudice to any other remedies available to Ideasol Australia at law or equity or under this Agreement.
5. Maintenance Support
Maintenance and technical support are not included or provided with this no-charge license. However,
Ideasol Australia may, but is not obligated to, provide bug fixes, enhancements, and other changes to the Software
during the Term of the license. Any changes made by Ideasol Australia to the Software shall be and remain at all
times proprietary to and the sole property of Ideasol Australia, and the provisions in this Agreement relating to the
confidential and proprietary nature of the Ideasol Australia Software and Confidential Information shall apply with
equal force and effect to such changes. Such changes may be used by Company under the Software license
contained herein solely for use with the Software.
6. Permission to Collect and Use Information
5.1. Ideasol Australia may collect information from and about Users to help us support and improve the Software and our
other products and services, for license enforcement, and for other business purposes. Ideasol Australia may use the information to suggest compliance solutions. This is one reason that we offer the Software at no charge and access to this information is partial
consideration for use of the Software. If applicable law, Company policy, or other requirements require that
Users be informed of or consent to the collection, use, and/or handling of information as described in this
Section, or that any other steps be taken, these are the sole responsibility of Company and Company may not
permit Users to access or use the Software without taking all necessary steps. Company will defend, hold
harmless and indemnify Ideasol Australia from and against any and all losses, claims, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including fees, fines, penalties, interest, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and
disbursements) as incurred arising out of, related or connected to Ideasol Australia’s collection, use, and handling
of information as provided for herein. A partial list of the information that Ideasol Australia may collect includes (but
is not limited to) Users’ names and email addresses.
5.2. Personal information will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. It may be necessary -
by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside the
Company’s and/or User’s country of residence for Ideasol Australia to disclose information, as well as when
necessary or appropriate for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public
importance. Ideasol Australia may also disclose information if Ideasol Australia determines that disclosure is reasonably
necessary to enforce its terms and conditions or protect its operations. Additionally, in the event of a
reorganization, merger, or sale Ideasol Australia may transfer any and all information Ideasol Australia collects to the
relevant third party. Information may be stored by Ideasol Australia in a personally identifiable manner. Ideasol Australia
uses various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, which may include third party
cookies, and anonymous identifiers.
5.3. Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Users, consents to Ideasol Australia’s collection and use of User
information as outlined here and to Ideasol Australia processing and using the information for the purposes given
above. If applicable law, Company policy, or other requirements require that Users be informed of or consent
to the collection, use, and/or handling of information as described in this Section, or that any other steps be
taken, these are the responsibility of Company and Users may not be permitted to access or use the Software
without taking all necessary steps. Company will defend, hold harmless and indemnify Ideasol Australia from and
against any and all losses, claims, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) as
incurred arising out of, related or connected to Ideasol Australia’s collection, use, and handling of information as
provided for herein. Ideasol Australia may process and store collected information on servers located outside the
country where the Company is located and/or Users live, including in the United States or in any other country
in which Ideasol Australia or its affiliates or service providers maintain facilities, even if the level of protection required
in that country is less than required by the country where the Company is located and/or Users live. Company
shall obtain all required consents and display all required notices, as necessary under applicable law to allow
Ideasol Australia to access, use, process and transfer User data in accordance with this Section 5, on its own behalf
and on behalf of its Users, consents to Ideasol Australia’s collection and use of User information as outlined above.

previously known without restriction, (b) received from a third party without restriction, (c) independently

expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason. In the event of actual or threatened breach of this
Section, Ideasol Australia will have no adequate remedy at law and will be entitled to immediate injunctive and other
equitable relief, without bond and without the necessity of showing actual money damages.

10. Non-assignment/Binding Agreement
Neither this Agreement nor any rights under this Agreement may be assigned or otherwise transferred by
Company, in whole or in part, whether voluntary or by operation of law, including by way of sale of assets,

Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall apply to, inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon the Parties

11. Miscellaneous
10.1. This Agreement (including the Attachments and any addenda hereto signed by both parties) contains the
entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all
previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between
the parties with respect to said subject matter. All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement to Company
are retained by Ideasol Australia. No terms, provisions or conditions of any purchase order, acknowledgment or
other business form that may be used in connection with the acquisition or licensing of the Software will have
any effect on the rights, duties or obligations of the parties under, or otherwise modify, this Agreement,
regardless of any failure of the other party to object to such terms, provisions or conditions. This Agreement
may not be amended, except by a writing signed by both parties. Any waiver of the provisions of this
Agreement or of a party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure,
neglect, or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time,
will not be construed and will not be deemed to be a waiver of such party's rights under this Agreement and
will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party's right
to take subsequent action.
10.2. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable, that provision will be deemed stricken and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full
force and effect insofar as it remains a workable instrument to accomplish the intent and purposes of the
parties; the parties will replace the severed provision with the provision that will come closest to reflecting the
intention of the parties underlying the severed provision but that will be valid, legal, and enforceable. No
exercise or enforcement by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement, including termination
under Section 8, will preclude the enforcement by such party of any other right or remedy under this Agreement
or that such party is entitled by law to enforce. The Software is subject to United States export laws and
regulations. Company may not export or re-export the Software or any technology received from Ideasol Australia
without the necessary and appropriate Australian and other applicable government licenses. The
provisions of Sections 2, 5, 6, 7, 8.4, 9, and 10 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for any
reason.
10.3. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Australia.
